**Coming Up**

Hello everyone! While we eagerly await the Android team to release the source code for their latest Android 14 version, we couldn't hold back from announcing what our next iteration at Paranoid Android will be.

We are pleased to inform you that we have decided to codename it "Uvite," and with this release, we are returning to our origins by reverting to one of our most recognizable brand identities over the years: the beautiful green accent.

**Paranoid Android Uvite Alpha**

We'd like to outline the roadmap for this Android 14-based version by the Paranoid Android team. We will begin releasing alphas as soon as our code reaches a minimum level of stability. We invite you to be part of this process, allowing us to utilize your feedback from the early stages and enhance Paranoid Android.

**OTA Update Status**

We understand that many of you have encountered issues related to our Over-The-Air (OTA) system application. We want to assure you that we are already working on perfecting it and getting it ready for those of you who wish to give it a try, especially with the numerous alphas your device will receive over time.

**New Website**

Of course, this wouldn't be complete without a proper and updated website based on Paranoid Android Uvite. It is now available for viewing on the [Paranoid Android website](https://paranoidandroid.co/). There, you can download our new builds once the source code is released, and we hope you'll feel right at home.

**Discord Community**

We are thrilled to inform you that we have recently been working on a Discord community. This will serve as a secondary space for all our content, complete with various channels, groups, and bug report sections for the platform and all our supported and upcoming devices. We are delighted to have you there, and we will strive to make it more user-friendly, efficient, and enjoyable for you. Feel free to join us at [Discord community](https://discord.gg/uDxwuMHam5).

**Supported Devices**

As for supported devices, you can keep track of updates through our [X account](https://x.com/paranoidaospa), official [Telegram channel](https://t.me/paranoidandroidofficial), or the new official Discord Community. We are putting in extra effort this time to make it easier for you to flash Paranoid Android, providing scripted zips from now on. We will post updates as soon as the alphas and/or alpha updates are available for your devices.
